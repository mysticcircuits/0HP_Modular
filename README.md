# 0HP_Modular
A collection of small circuit boards meant to save space in a Eurorack modular synthesizer.

However they can be adapted and used in all kinds of scenarios, including other formats.

All of the 0HPs have a video build guide where I walk you through the build in real time.  These modules are ideal for DIY beginners and I wanted to make things easier for beginners to follow along like a Bob Ross video.  For the relevant videos, look at the links below:
